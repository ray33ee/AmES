 - Implement sequence as a list of closures, not a list of enums
 - Find a way to squash 256-bit key into 128 bit for use in xor step, squash it down using STATE_SIZE as the new size
 - Convert this project into a crate, (not an executable) and let user configure BlockCipher::BlockSize
    - When configuring block size, both BlockCipher::BlockSize and STATE_SIZE must be updated
    - Let the user also configure ROUND_COUNT_RANGE.
    - Put all the S-box stuff in their own package
 - Modify the generation of SBoxs so that they are created as valid first time
